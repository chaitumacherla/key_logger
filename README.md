This project is about writing the program that records key stikes enetered by the user.

There are two different types of keyloggers. They are:

1.Local Keylogger: It records the keys entered on specific location.

2.Remote Keylogger: It records the keys entered in target computer for a specific timeinterval.

Here, we are trying create a remote keylogger for a specific timeinterval.
